1.Take values of length and breadth of a rectangle from user and check if it is square or not.
2. A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than 1000.
Ask user for quantity
Suppose, one unit will cost 100.
Judge and print total cost for user.

3. A school has following rules for grading system:
a. Below 25 - F
b. 25 to 45 - E
c. 45 to 50 - D
d. 50 to 60 - C
e. 60 to 80 - B
f. Above 80 - A
Ask user to enter marks and print the corresponding grade.

4. A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendence is less than 75%.
Take following input from user
Number of classes held
Number of classes attended.
And print
percentage of class attended
Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not.

5. Ask user to enter age, gender(M or F ), marital status ( Y or N ) and then using following rules print their place of service.
if employee is female, then she will work only in urban areas.

if employee is a male and age is in between 20 to 40 then he may work in anywhere

if employee is male and age is in between 40 t0 60 then he will work in urban areas only.

And any other input of age should print "ERROR".

6. A 4 digit number is entered through keyboard. Write a program to print a new number with digits reversed as of orignal one. E.g.-
INPUT : 1234        OUTPUT : 4321
INPUT : 5982        OUTPUT : 2895

7. 
Take 10 integers from keyboard using loop and print their average value on the screen.

8. Write a Java program to calculate factorial of a number.

9. Take integer inputs from user until he/she presses q ( Ask to press q to quit after every integer input ). Print average and product of all numbers.

10.Write a Java program to convert seconds to hour, minute and seconds.  
Sample Output:
Input seconds: 86399                                                   
23:59:59

11. Given two ints, each in the range 10..99, return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as the 2 in 12 and 23. (Note: division, e.g. n/10, gives the left digit while the % "mod" n%10 gives the right digit.)
shareDigit(12, 23) → true
shareDigit(12, 43) → false
shareDigit(12, 44) → false

12. 
You have a green lottery ticket, with ints a, b, and c on it. If the numbers are all different from each other, the result is 0. If all of the numbers are the same, the result is 20. If two of the numbers are the same, the result is 10.
greenTicket(1, 2, 3) → 0
greenTicket(2, 2, 2) → 20
greenTicket(1, 1, 2) → 10
